This subungual lesion usually presents as a painful dorsomedial mass, often associated with elevation and ultimately ulceration of the nail plate and bed.

Nephrotic syndrome type 1 (OMIM: 256300) presents with prenatal onset of massive proteinuria followed by severe steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome at birth with rapid progression to CHRONIC KIDNEY FAILURE. Germline mutations have been identified in the NPHS1 gene for type 1; NPHS2 gene for type 2 (OMIM: 600995); and the PLCE1 gene for type 3 (OMIM: 610725).

Iron damage to pancreatic cells may cause DIABETES MELLITUS and iron accumulation in the tissues and organs results in a deficiency of iron in the blood, leading to ANEMIA; anemia and diabetes usually occur in young adulthood. Excess iron may also affect the eye, causing RETINAL DEGENERATION.  Mutations in the CP gene have been identified. OMIM: 604290

Skin is most commonly affected on the legs, less commonly on the arms and trunk, and rarely do they involve the face and scalp. It is occasionally associated with skin ulceration or skin atrophy; skin symptoms usually improve with age. Can occur alone or along with a variety of other birth defects, particularly those involving undergrowth or overgrowth of the same arm or leg. Most cases are thought to be sporadic, familial cases appear to be autosomal recessive. OMIM: 219250

NO = A rare disorder characterized by the triad of HEMOPTYSIS, IRON-DEFICIENCY ANEMIA, and transient pulmonary infiltrates observed by RADIOGRAPHY. The underlying disease mechanism is a propensity to recurrent intrapulmonary hemorrhage. Even though large amounts of iron are laid down in the lung, with normal or increased total body iron, anemia occurs because of inability of the erythron to use iron sequestered in pulmonary MACROPHAGES. RESPIRATORY INSUFFICENCY may result from PULMONARY FIBROSIS in advanced cases. OMIM: 178550

Three phenotypic subtypes are recognized. The early infantile form is associated with HYDROPS FETALIS; EDEMA; ASCITES, visceromegaly, skeletal dysplasia, and early death. The late infantile type is characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, growth retardation, cardiac involvement, and rare occurrence of neurologic signs. The juvenile/adult form is characterized by MYOCLONUS;  ATAXIA; ANGIOKERATOMA; INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY, neurologic deterioration, absence of visceromegaly, and long survival. The majority of reported patients belong to the juvenile/adult group and are mainly of Japanese origin. Mutations in the CTSA gene have been identified. OMIM: 256540

Patients with BRSS develop multiple skin appendage neoplasms including cylindromas, trichoepitheliomas, and spiradenomas. Patients with familial cylindromatosis have only cylindromas, and those with MFT1 have only trichoepitheliomas. However, because these disorders show overlapping phenotypic features, and because different manifestations of each have been described within a single family, many consider these disorders to represent a phenotypic spectrum of a single disease entity. All are caused by mutations in the CYLD gene.

Initial growth is slow and progressive, after which it tends to remain stable in size, although regression has been reported in some cases.

Individuals have low numbers of MEGAKARYOCYTES and frequently present with bleeding episodes in the first year of life that diminish in frequency and severity with age. The severity of skeletal anomalies varies from absence of radii to virtual absence of upper limbs, with or without lower limb defects. This disorder is caused by a combination of null mutation of the RBM8A gene through deletion on one copy of chromosome 1q21.1 and 1 of 2 low-frequency noncoding single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in RBM8A on the other.

NO = A rare autosomal recessive neurologic disorder characterized by sensorineural hearing loss and a variety of CRANIAL NERVE palsies. Spinal motor nerves and, less commonly, upper motor neurons are sometimes affected, resulting in a phenotype similar to  AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS. Onset is typically in the second decade, but may be earlier or later. Hearing loss tends to precede the onset of neurologic signs. However, patients with very early onset may present with bulbar palsy and may not develop hearing loss until later. The symptoms, severity, and disease duration are variable. Mutations in the SLC52A3 gene have been identified. OMIM: 211530

NO = A rare autosomal recessive disorder in which individuals cannot synthesize endogenous ESTROGENS. In utero, this results in VIRILIZATION of both the fetus and mother, since the PLACENTA converts the precursor, DEHYDROEPIANDROSTERONE SULFATE, to TESTOSTERONE. Affected mothers exhibit HISUTISM and ACNE, which resolve following delivery. Affected female infants exhibit PSEUDOHERMAPHRODITISM at birth followed by cystic ovaries, delays in sexual development, and hirsutism at adolescence. Males may be asymptomatic at birth but can later exhibit tall stature, bone growth abnormalities and OBESITY, infertility and gynecomastia. Mutations in the CYP19A1 gene have been identified.

In most cases, uterus and fallopian tubes are absent but small tubular structures interpreted as mullerian or wolffian duct rudiments (or both) are present. Virilizing effects due to early testicular tissue range from none or very slight external genital abnormalities in phenotypic females to the anorchic phenotypic male . Most affected individuals lack a vagina but a urogenital sinus or pseudovaginal urethral outpouching is found. Partial labioscrotal fusion and clitoris enlargement are common but breast development is absent. Nongenital anomalies may also be present.

Complete trisomy 9, where all cells have an extra copy, usually results in miscarriage or death in the neonatal period. Thus, most viable individuals have partial trisomy 9, where only certain portions of the chromosome are duplicated, or mosaic trisomy 9p, where there is an extra copy only in certain tissues. Such individuals may have craniofacial and growth abnormalities, congenital heart defects, and intellectual disability. The severity of these symptoms depends on which genes are duplicated and which cell populations are affected.

Other common features include a thin nose and SYNDACTYLY between the fourth and fifth fingers. HYPOTRICHOSIS, syndactyly of the toes, curvature of fingers, MICROCEPHALY, and CLEFT PALATE may also occur but are less common. Some patients may also experience ATAXIA, MUSCLE SPASTICITY, hearing loss, and speech difficulties. Mutations in the GJA1 gene have been identified. OMIM: 164200

NO = An X-linked movement disorder that affects predominantly males of Filipino descent and is characterized by PARKINSONISM followed by DYSTONIA later in life.  In the mildest cases, affected individuals have slowly progressive parkinsonism with little or no dystonia. More severe cases involve dystonia that rapidly becomes generalized. It is caused by an SVA (short interspersed nuclear element, variable number of tandem repeats, and Alu composite) RETROTRANSPOSON insertion in an INTRON of the TAF1 gene. OMIM: 314250

NO = An endogenous form of adrenal Cushing syndrome characterized by multiple bilateral adrenocortical nodules that cause a striking enlargement of the ADRENAL GLANDS. Although some familial cases have been reported, the vast majority of AIMAH cases are sporadic. Patients typically present in the fifth and sixth decades of life, approximately 10 years later than most patients with other causes of Cushing syndrome. Somatic mutations in the GNAS gene have been identified. OMIM: 219080

The lesions may be triggered by local injury and/or infection and often recur after local excision. Lesions of other mucous membranes often occur in the mouth, nasopharynx, trachea, and female genital tract. Some affected children also have congenital occlusive HYDROCEPHALUS.

Secondary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is associated with functional impairment or reduced numbers of alveolar MACROPHAGES, as occurs in some hematologic cancers,  IMMUNOSUPPRESSION, inhalation of inorganic dust or toxic fumes, and certain infections. Congenital pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is a rare, severe, often fatal disorder of newborns associated with PULMONARY SURFACTANT metabolism dysfunction caused by mutations in genes involved in surfactant metabolism.
